	<h1>More HTML</h1>
	<p>The subject of this lab is to add links and images to our html sites.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>I didn't really have any challenges this lab. I have added images and links to websites before so it was pretty easy to do it again.</p>
	<h3>Results</h3>
	<p>The page you are viewing shows that I was able to complete this lab. Here are some of my favorite basketball pictures from high school:</p>
