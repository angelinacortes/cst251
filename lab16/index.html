				<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p>The subject of this lab is to experiment with the fancy CSS we learned in the lecture.</p>
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>I didn't really have any problems this lab either. It was more complicated than the previous lab but still fun to do.</p>
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>The page you are viewing shows that I was able to complete this lab. </p>

				<div id=callout>
					<h2>Callout</h2>
						<li>More Backgrounds- I added an image as the background.</li>
						<li>Transitions- I added a transition where the image shrinks when you hover over it. I added another transition where the opacity goes down by by 10% when you hover over the content of the page.</li>
						<li>Animation- I added an animation where the color of the content goes from pink, fades to green for 5 seconds, and goes back to pink. This happens when you first go on the page.</li>
						<li>Columns- I added two columns of words.</li>
				</div>

<!-- I got this code from: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp -->
			<style>
				main {
				  background-color: #fcd9ed;
				  animation-name: example;
				  animation-duration: 5s;
				}

				@keyframes example {
				  from {background-color: #fcd9ed;}
				  to {background-color: #96b4a9;}
				}
			</style>
