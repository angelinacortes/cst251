		<p>Hi! My name is Angelina Cortes and I am a freshman at CSUMB. I love to play basketball, go to the beach, skateboard, watch TV and hang out with friends/family.</p>
		<p>What I am excited to learn in this Web Tools class is how to code and build amazing websites.</p>
		<p>What I hope to do with my new found web development knowledge is to use it to make me a better designer and use it in my future career.</p>
