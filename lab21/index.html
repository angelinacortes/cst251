<h2>Lab 21</h2>

<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>The subject of this lab is to take my ideas from the previous assignment, get feedback from my team, and further develop a few of these ideas.</p></div>
<div class="col">
<h2>Problems</h2>
<p> This lab was pretty easy overall. It was fun to further develop my ideas and create better sketches. The feedback I received from my group was that I need to add more boxes because there is going to be lots of information included on the website. They all liked the idea of breaking up an image and putting the image in different boxes. They also liked how I included an image of a yo-yo string to guide where the reader of the website should read next. Overall, they liked my sketches and thought they were creative and well organized.</p></div>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The page you are viewing and the sketches I drew show that I was able to complete this lab.</p></div>
