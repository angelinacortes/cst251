		<h1>File Transfer</h1>
		<p>The subject of this lab is learning the difference between making changes locally vs. uploading to a server. In order to do this, we must follow the "File Transfer Protocol".</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>We didn't really have any challenges this lab. It was an adjustment learning how to upload to a server the first time. Since we have already done this before, it was pretty easy to do it for this lab.</p>
		<h3>Results</h3>
		<p>The page you are viewing shows that we were able to complete this lab. Here is a screenshot of the code of this page:</p>
